After having configured all devices, we can now download the configuration to the actual KNX devices. The download process can be controlled from every view that provides access to devices, like the ‘Buildings’ panel. To find the devices we want to download, we will use the so-called dynamic folders. A dynamic folder basically is a pre-defined filter. In this example, we would like to find all devices that have not yet been downloaded at all. So, all we need to do is to select the dynamic folder ‘Initial Devices’. If you now select one of the devices, you can see that neither the individual address nor the application program or the parameters have been downloaded so far. So, let’s simply select all the devices here and click on the ‘Download menu’. It provides several different functions. For instance, if you only want to download the individual address, you can choose this option. 

Since we want to download the complete configuration including the individual address, we will use the option ‘Download all’. You can monitor the download process in the container ‘Pending Operations’ in the sidebar or in the status bar if you want to keep on working during the download. From that moment on, ETS is waiting for you to press the programming button of the first device to be programmed. In our example this is the switch actuator. Usually, by pressing the programming button of a KNX device, an LED switches on to indicate that the device is in programming mode awaiting to be programmed. Once the download is finished, you can see that the programming status of the devices has changed in this column.


With this last step we finally have come to end of our ETS6 training. We have seen all the basic concepts that are required to setup a small project. For further support go to knx.org to find a certified ETS training centre near you.
